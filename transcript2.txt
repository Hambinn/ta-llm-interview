INTERVIEWER:
Can you tell me about a specific situation at Tokopedia where you were tasked with developing or improving a REST API using Django?

CANDIDATE:
In a previous project at Tokopedia, I worked on a web application, although it wasn't built with Django, it was built with Flask. I primarily handled frontend development with some backend work.                       

INTERVIEWER:
What specific task were you given regarding the backend work, particularly related to REST APIs, during that project?

CANDIDATE:
My backend experience there focused on using basic Python for data processing. The APIs that I built were for one of the microservices in the Tokopedia system.

INTERVIEWER:
Can you describe the actions you took to build those APIs for the microservices, especially given your primary focus was on frontend development?

CANDIDATE:
Well, I usually have a sprint meeting every 2 weeks and daily standup meetings. From the sprint meeting I gained the business requirements, and then gives updates and ask questions at the daily meetings. Since I was building a frontend service for the internal use of the company, I was also able to build any necessary APIs for the service. Building the APIs doesn't take much time compared to developing the front end.

INTERVIEWER:
What were the results or outcomes of your efforts in building those APIs for the service, in terms of performance, integration, or user feedback?

CANDIDATE:
The APIs work as intended in helping the frontend service according to the business requirements. I always finsihed my sprint tasks at the end of every sprint.
