Since this is a Behavioral Event Interview focused on the candidate's ability to build well-structured REST APIs using Django, let's start with the situation:

1. Can you describe a specific situation at Tokopedia where you were tasked with developing or improving a REST API using Django?

CANDIDATE:
Yes, I was in the backend development team at Tokopedia. My team was building a platform to manage inventory and sales data for a retail company. This required a well-structured database and APIs for interacting with the data from various systems.

My responsibility was designing the Django models,  mapping them to database tables, and implementing the REST API endpoints according to the business requirements. 

INTERVIEWER:
3. What actions did you take to ensure that the models and REST API endpoints you were implementing would meet the business requirements effectively?

CANDIDATE:
I carefully analyzed the business requirements and designed models that accurately represented relationships between products, orders, and customers. I used Django's ORM effectively to write efficient database queries. For the API, I used the Django REST framework, ensuring proper serialization, pagination, and authentication.

INTERVIEWER:
4. Can you describe the results of your actions, particularly how your work on the Django models and REST API endpoints impacted the project or the organization as a whole?

CANDIDATE:
The models and APIs I developed provided a solid foundation, enabling seamless communication between the frontend, external systems, and the database. This streamlined data flow and enhanced overall application performance. The models and APIs that I developed ended up being pushed to the production server.
